I plan on trying to copy the Google Classroom website. Starting with the dashboard page where it lists all the classes.

Outcome - I got most of the page done. Really all that's left is some tweeks like adding the profile picture to the right spot (kinda tricky area). Also, I need to work with some text and image formatting. It was pretty easy, but then again I picked an easy first day target.
